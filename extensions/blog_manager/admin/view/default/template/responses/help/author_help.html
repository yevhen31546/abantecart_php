<h3>Blog Author</h3>

<p><strong>Creating a New Author</strong></p>

<p>It is highly recommended to create at least one author for your blog. The author can be the blog owner or another entity. If no author is created, the blog owner 
will be listed as the author but with no additional data or author page.</p>

<p><strong>User Based Blog</strong></p>
<p>If your blog is user based (login required to post comments) you must create a user first, then add the user as an author. This is required in order to maintain login credential integrity. A drop down list of users 
will be visible at the top of the author form showing all users who are currently not authors. Selecting a user will automatically populate the form with available information. At a minimum, you must
enter data in the required fields.</p>

<p><strong>Non-User Based Blog</strong></p>

<p>Enter data in the required fields.</p>
