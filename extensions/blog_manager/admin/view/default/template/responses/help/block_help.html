<h3>Block Settings</h3>
<p>Some convenience blocks have been provided for blog navigation. Once placed on your layout, they must also be activated on this page before they are visible on your blog pages.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Blog Categories</strong> A listing of blog categories. It is designed to use in the left or right sidebar.</li>
<li><strong>Blog Archive</strong> A listing of blog articles listed by month/year. It is designed to use in the left or right sidebar.</li>
<li><strong>Blog Feed</strong> A graphic link to your blog feed. It is designed to use in the left or right sidebar.</li>
<li><strong>Blog Author</strong> A listing of blog authors. It is designed to use in the left or right sidebar.</li>
<li><strong>Blog Active</strong> A listing of active articles sorted by most active to least active. It is designed to use in the left or right sidebar.</li>
<li><strong>Blog Popular</strong> A listing of popular articles sorted by most popular to least popular. It is designed to use in the left or right sidebar.</li>
<li><strong>Blog Latest</strong> A listing of latest blog activity, both new articles and comments. It is designed to use in the left or right sidebar. This block is intended to be placed on your stores home page.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each listing block has settings for the minimum, limit, and maximum amount of listings.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>minimum</strong> setting is the amount of qualified items for the block to exist before the block will be shown. The minimum value is 1. Set the minimum value to a number where it makes sense to show the block.</li>
<li>The <strong>limit</strong> setting is used when you only want to show a set amount of listings. An example would be if you only wanted to only show a certain amount of popular listings. If the amount of listings available is more,
button will be visible to show more listings up to the maximum amount.</li>
<li>The <strong>maximum</strong> settings is the amount of listings available to be shown. If you set the limit amount and the maximum amount to the same number, the more button will not be visible.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>Blog Top Menu</strong> is a customizable menu bar designed to be placed in the header bottom section of your page. You can customize the menu by including items from the selected list. The listing elements 
will only show if the block is active regardless if the block is placed on your page or not and if the minimum amount is met. The maximum amount set will be shown in the dropdown.</p>

<p>If you are using any of the side column blocks, they will disappear as the screen size gets smaller. You can adjust the size by editing your blog.css file. The blog top menu will also convert to a drop down 
as the screen size gets smaller. If you are using the side menus and not the top menu bar, one trick is to place both on your page and then set .top_menu_bar to display: none in your css file. You will not see the top 
menu at full screen but when the screen size is smaller, the drop down will appear.</p>

<p>If you are restricting comment posting to your blog, there is also a <strong>Blog Login</strong> block available. It is designed to use in the left or right sidebar. When logged in, the user sees links to the user settings pages.</p>
