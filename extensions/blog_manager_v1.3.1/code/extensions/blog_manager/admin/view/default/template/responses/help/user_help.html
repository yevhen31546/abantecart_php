<h3>Blog User</h3>
<p>The Blog user interface is only active if you are restricted comment post access to your blog.</p>

<p><strong>Creating a New User</strong></p>

<p>New users can be created in a number of ways. If you are using your customers as your source data, a new user is created when a new customer registers. Existing customers are automatically
granted blog access. If you are using separate login credentials for your blog, a new user is created when they register. The last way is with manual creation. You can create new users regardless of the data source you are using.</p>

<p>To create a new user, complete the add user form. At a minimum, you need to enter the required data. Users will have access to edit their own settings once logged in to your blog.</p>


<p><strong>Disabling a User</strong></p>
<p> You can prevent a user from accessing your blog without deleting the users by switching the status to off.</p>
<p><strong>Deleting a User</strong></p>
<p> You can delete a user in entirety by clicking the delete icon in the listing view. Note that when you delete a user the user is deleted from the system, but previous comments are retained with the user's name. This 
is to retain integrity with the comment reply relationship. You can manually delete comments by editing your blog comments.</p>
